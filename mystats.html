        <p>Biryani is the must try food in southern part of India,especially in <b>Hyderabad</b>.It is a flavourous rice item made with variety of spices.Chicken is the main item and it will be cooked it in such a way that the flavourous smell of the masala and ghee added will not be let out by closing it with the lid tightly.So that the whole flavour will be felt with each and every bite till the end.It is a very high protien rich food.I love this food for the flavours.</p>
